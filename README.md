üó∫Ô∏è Offline Navigation Map with Python, Dijkstra & OSM
An Offline Navigation System uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as the map source and Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm for shortest path routing. The map and routing logic work completely offline, making it ideal for crisis zones, rural areas, or any no-signal environments.
Key Components:
1.	OSM Data:
o	Download .osm or .pbf files of the target region.
o	Extract roads, intersections (nodes), and ways (edges) from OSM.
o	Tools: osmnx, pyrosm, or manual parsing.
2.	Graph Construction (Python):
o	Build a graph data structure (nodes = intersections, edges = roads).
o	Edge weights = road distance, time, or custom factors (like blocked roads).
3.	Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm (Python):
o	Classic shortest path algorithm.
o	Finds the optimal route from source node to destination node.
o	Efficient for small/medium graphs (for city-scale offline apps).
4.	Offline Map Display:
o	Leaflet.js or folium (Python wrapper around Leaflet) to render the map.
o	Can overlay routes, markers, and map tiles (served locally).
